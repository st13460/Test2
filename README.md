# Description

I connected my GitHub repository to Eclipse to show progressive development and version control. After setting up a project board, I added relevant issues and assigned them to myself for tracking progress. For each issue, I created a separate branches to maintain organized and structured changes. I then edited and updated each test case directly in Eclipse, ensuring proper functionality before committing the changes with comments. Once all updates were completed, I created pull requests, merged in the main branch, and reviewed the project board to verify that the issues were successfully resolved.
